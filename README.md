## Instructions

### Intro Screen
 * Turtle Pong is a game for two players.
 * The computer will take the field for any absent human players.
 * To INSERT MONEY, press __(X)__ or press __(O)__. No change return slot.
  * Whenever two humans are available, simply insert money with both paddles. Or, press __pause__ then choose __2-PLAYER GAME__.
  * If only one human is available, or if you do not have enough money for two players, then only insert money with the paddle you want to play with.

### Game Play
Move your player around on the field, wherever you want within your goal area. Chalk outlines your goal area. Try to throw the turtle past your friend to score goals.

Focus on the field; don't get distracted by the fans in the grandstands. 

#### Service
 * When the turtle is up for grabs in the middle of the field, press and hold your __(O)__ button to take it, and hold it.
 * While you hold the button, a meter on screen shows you winding up for the serve. The meter helps you mete out the power of your serve (like how hard the turtle makes his muscles). Keep holding __(O)__..
 * If you are walking when you let go, your movement will affect..
 * Let go __(O)__ to serve! _Yeah, let that puppy fly!!_
  * Pro Tip: Surprise your opponent with flinging a turtle flying right at him, or try to sneak it past him along the edge.
  * About Manners: Most players prefer to serve after they just lost a point. This is a matter between the players. _There is no referee in STP4. Don't make us program one!!_

#### Ball in Play
 * Run around with the directional keypad.
 * Get in position (get in the turtle's way so your paddle will hit it).
 * You can get a more solid hit if you dig in your feet (press _(O)_).
  * Pro Tip: If you're pretty sure you're in the right spot, and want to put a bit more pep on your return, holding _(O)_ is the way to go!
 * Watch out: Every time you miss, the turtle flies on to goal worth one point for your opponent.
