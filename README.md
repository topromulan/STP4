# Super Turtle Pong 4

*Welcome to Turtle Pong Stadium*

## Abstract

Turtle Pong is a classic game played with two paddles, by bouncing one lucky turtle around a field. The goal is to hit that (un)lucky one turtle past the other player nine times. Inspiration for the human game "Regular Pong".

## Motivation

Super Turtle Pong 4 brings back the authentic feel of these historic MacroWave products and takes them to the next level with 2d handling and extra fan seating. The advantages of being a fourth generation Turtle Pong implementation pair well with the incredible future-now expansive PICO-8 architecture.

## Instructions

### Intro Screen
 * Turtle Pong is a game for two players.
 * To INSERT MONEY, press any button.
  * If only one human is available, or if you do not have enough money for two players, then only insert money with the paddle you want to play with.
  * If two humans are available, simply insert money with both paddles. Or, hit pause and choose to start a 2-Player game.
   * Tip: Starting the game from the pause menu is easier when playing with kids.
 * Note: Artificial Intelligence will take the field for any absent human players (or present players who did not insert money).

### Game Play

Move your player to the desired standing position within your end of the field. Chalk outlines your end. Focus on the field when you start and ignore the different kinds of Turtle Pong fans in the grandstands. They just watch. After the game, they will leave through the exit in an orderly fashion while you party. Except if your opponent won, then it is they who party. To be a winner, you need to score nine points! Here is your guide to scoring those nine points*:

*AKA "the long road to nine"

#### Service
 * Move your player by means of your directional keypad.
 * When an the lucky turtle is up for grabs in the middle of the grass, press and hold down the "O" button, to take it and hold it.
 * A meter on screen shows you winding up for the serve. This helps you measure out the power of your serve. Keep holding it..
 * You may still move around. Your movement affects the trajectory of the serve when released.
 * Release "O" to serve.
  * Pro Tip: Surprise your opponent with flinging a turtle flying right at him, or try to sneak it past him along the edge.
  * About Manners: Most players prefer to serve after they just lost a point. This is a matter between the players.

#### Ball in Play
 * Move your player by means of your directional keypad.
 * Try to hit the turtle by moving your paddle into its way!
 * Pressing "O" and you dig in your feet for extra power on the hit.
  * Pro Tip: If you're pretty sure you're in the right spot, and want to put a bit more pep on your return, holding "O" is the way to go! 
 * To hit trickier angles, try using the edges of your paddle.

### Party
 * The first player who achieves nine points is thrown a party.
 * To leave the party early and get started on your next whuppin', press both buttons at once, after you waited a sec.
