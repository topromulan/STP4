# Super Turtle Pong 4

*Welcome to Turtle Pong Stadium*

## Abstract

Turtle Pong is a classic game played with two paddles, by bouncing one lucky turtle around a field. The goal is to hit that (un)lucky one turtle past the other player nine times. Inspiration for the human game "Regular Pong".

## Motivation

Super Turtle Pong 4 brings back the authentic feel of these historic MacroWave products and takes them to the next level with 2d handling and extra fan seating. The advantages of being a fourth generation Turtle Pong implementation pair well with the incredible future-now expansive PICO-8 architecture.

## Instructions

### Intro Screen
 * Turtle Pong is a game for two players.
 * To INSERT MONEY, press __(X)__ or press __(O)__. No change.
  * If two humans are available, simply insert money with both paddles. Or, press __pause__ then choose __2-PLAYER GAME__.
  * If only one human is available, or if you do not have enough money for two players, then only insert money with the paddle you want to play with.
 * Note: Artificial Intelligence will take the field for any absent human players (or present players who did not insert money).
 * Bonus info: Also if you have no money you can also choose "AI VS AI MATCH"
 * Finally: Want a quicker duel? Press pause and choose BEST 2 OUT OF 3.

### Game Play
Move your player around within your area of the field. Chalk outlines both players' goal areas. Try to throw the turtle past your friend to score goals.

Focus on the field; don't get distracted by the fans in the grandstands. 

#### Service
 * Run around with the directional keypad.
 * When the turtle is up for grabs in the middle of the field, press and hold your __(O)__ button to take it and hold it.
 * A meter on screen shows you winding up for the serve. The meter helps you mete out the power of your serve. Keep holding __(O)__..
 * Your movement affects the trajectory of the serve when released.
 * Let go __(O)__ to serve! _Yeah, let that puppy fly!!_
  * Pro Tip: Surprise your opponent with flinging a turtle flying right at him, or try to sneak it past him along the edge.
  * About Manners: Most players prefer to serve after they just lost a point. This is a matter between the players. _There is no referee in STP4. Don't make us program one!!_

#### Ball in Play
 * Run around with the directional keypad.
 * Get in position (get in the turtle's way so your paddle will hit it).
 * You can get a more solid hit if you dig in your feet (press _(O)_).
  * Pro Tip: If you're pretty sure you're in the right spot, and want to put a bit more pep on your return, holding _(O)_ is the way to go! 
 * Control the angles according to which part of your paddle hits the turtle.

#### Direct Deposit System
 * Points may be directly awarded in the _pause_ menu. This has several functionalities.
  * Give a new player a handicap.
  * Mitigate a player dispute.
  * Bribe a player.

### Party!
